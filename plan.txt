Demo:

0. object only changes at boundary
 
 
requirements:
  value provider
  value persister
  flow transaction
  
  3 flows 
    1) r/w (and then a second time by another user)
    2) limited r/w (show cannot change id)
  
  
1. an object can only be altered if the object has a persister (even if bug in the flow ) 

2. An object is 'owned'. Another user cannot access the owned object

3. an object can have segmented properties that are altered independently
